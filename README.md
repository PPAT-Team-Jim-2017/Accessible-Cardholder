# Accessible-Cardholder
This cardholder was designed initially for the use of a power wheelchair user with limited hand dexterity. The intent was to give him more independence by allowing him to access his cards without the help of others. This cardholder could be of help to anyone who wants to be able to easily access their cards on their wheelchair.
